        <h2>Traditions & Heritage</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippines before the arrival of colonial powers had a vibrant culture influenced by a diverse mix of indigenous traditions. 
            People lived in small, self-sustained communities governed by a local chieftain, known as a Datu. 
            The pre-colonial Filipinos were skilled in various arts such as weaving, pottery, and metallurgy. They also had a unique system of writing known as Baybayin.
        </p>

        <h2>Language & Literature</h2>
        <p>
            Baybayin was the writing system used in the Philippines before Spanish colonization. It was an abugida (syllabic alphabet) and was primarily used for poetry and storytelling. 
            Oral tradition was a significant aspect of pre-colonial Filipino culture, and stories were passed down through generations through chants, songs, and epic poems like the *Hinilawod*.
        </p>

        <h2>Religion & Beliefs</h2>
        <p>
            Filipinos before colonization practiced animism and had a rich pantheon of gods, goddesses, and spirits. 
            They believed in the power of nature and its connection to daily life, from their agricultural practices to their rituals in honoring ancestors.
